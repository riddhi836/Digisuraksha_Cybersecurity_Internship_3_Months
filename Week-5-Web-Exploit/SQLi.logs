SQLi logsâ€”short for SQL Injection logsâ€”are records that capture attempts to 
 exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. 
 These logs are crucial for security monitoring, incident response, and digital forensics.

 ### ðŸ§¨What SQLi Logs Typically Contain
# Suspicious SQL queries: 
Attempts to manipulate database queries like ' OR '1'='1 or UNION SELECT.

# Request metadata: 
IP address, timestamp, user-agent, and referrer.

# Targeted endpoints: 
URLs or parameters where the injection was attempted 
(e.g., /login.php?user=admin'--).

# HTTP methods: 
Often GET or POST, showing how the payload was delivered.

# Response codes: 
Status like 200, 403, or 500 that hint at success or failure.

# Payloads: 
The actual malicious input used to test or exploit the vulnerability.
