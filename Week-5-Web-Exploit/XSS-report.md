# XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Report

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of web vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts‚Äîusually JavaScript‚Äîinto webpages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, hijack sessions, redirect users, or deface websites. It‚Äôs one of the most common and dangerous issues in web security.

## üß® Types of XSS Attacks

| Type         | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stored XSS**    | Malicious script is saved on the server (e.g., in a comment or profile field) and executed when others view it. |
| **Reflected XSS** | Script is embedded in a URL or form input and reflected back in the response (e.g., error messages). |
| **DOM-Based XSS** | Script is executed due to insecure client-side JavaScript manipulating the DOM.              |
| **Blind XSS**     | Payload is stored and triggered in a backend system (e.g., admin panel), making it harder to detect. |
