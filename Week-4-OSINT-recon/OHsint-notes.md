OhSINT is a beginner-friendly CTF (Capture the Flag) challenge hosted on TryHackMe that introduces you to the world of OSINT—Open Source Intelligence2. It’s a hands-on exercise where you start with just a single image and use publicly available information to uncover a series of clues about a fictional target.

### 🕵️ What You’ll Learn in OhSINT
* Metadata extraction: Use tools like ExifTool to pull GPS coordinates, author info, and timestamps from an image.

*Reverse image search: Identify avatars or reused images across platforms.

*Social media sleuthing: Track usernames across Twitter/X, GitHub, and blogs.

*Wi-Fi tracking: Use BSSID data with WiGLE.net to geolocate wireless access points.

*Source code inspection: Reveal hidden data like passwords embedded in HTML.

### 🧩 Sample Clues You’ll Uncover
The user’s avatar (e.g., a raccoon or cat)

Their city (e.g., London)

SSID of their Wi-Fi (e.g., UnileverWiFi)

Personal email address (e.g., found on GitHub)

Vacation location (e.g., New York)

Hidden password (e.g., embedded in blog source code)

### 🛠️ Tools You Might Use
ExifTool or exiv2 for metadata

Reverse image search engines like TinEye

WiGLE for BSSID lookup

Browser dev tools for HTML inspection
